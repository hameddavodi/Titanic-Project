## Titanic-Project

The Titanic project in Kaggle is a popular data science competition that involves predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and ticket fare. The dataset used in this project contains information about 891 passengers who were onboard the Titanic when it sank in 1912.

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not based on the given features. Participants are required to preprocess the data, perform feature engineering, and train various machine learning algorithms to achieve the highest accuracy score.

The Titanic project is a great way for beginners to get started with data science and machine learning. It provides an opportunity to learn various techniques such as data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, participants can also learn from other submissions and explore different approaches used by other data scientists.
